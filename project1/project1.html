	      <h2>Describe how search engines work</h2>
		    <p>
			  Search engines are functional through the acts of crawling and building.
			  Crawling involves allowing algorithmic robots to reach a document on the web.
			  In terms of building, search engines construct data centers that store information for users to access.
			  However depending on certain queries, each listing in the storage is arranged by relevance and popularity.

	     <h2>Explain the importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags</h2>
		   <p>
		      Keywords are used to ensure the match up to what users are looking for.
			  This is an important aspect to Search Engine Optimization (SEO) due to it tracking specific indexes, rather than focusing on other ones in a database.
			  When keywords are converted into meta tags, what is being witnessed is: keyword abuse.
			  The importance of this is impacted through the act of "stuffing."
			  It's important to avoid this because a good majority of search engines aren't able to comprehend a huge amount of text.
			  Considering that meta tags function off of information within the website's content.

	     <h2>List the four elements that comprise writing relevant content links </h2>
		   <ol>
		     <li>Links have to function as expert, authoritative, and trustworthy in order to provide user intent.</li>
			 <li>Links can either be documented as "unfollowed," which keeps search engines from picking up the content of the link; or they can be "followed" which allows it.</li>
			 <li>Link profile summaries should be honest, and should express each vote was earned appropriately.</li>
			 <li>Links have to relay qualified traffic to your website. In retrospect the audience should find value in your site.</li>

	     <h2>What constitutes good heading hierarchy and include an example with more than one heading tag</h2>
		   <p>
		      The hierarchy of a webpage is supposed to rank from the most important to the least important.
			  In a HTML document the heading that has more value on the page, will have a &lt;h1&gt;.
			  Meanwhile the the element with the least of importance will have &lt;h6&gt;.
			  Regardless, the order of each element must follow each other individually by one.
			  This means that neither heading elements should skip over six.
			  For instance the correct way to implement headings is with this:		  
			  <br>
			     &lt;h1&gt;Garfield&lt;/h1&gt;
