		    <p>
                Responsive design is an important aspect to the user experience. 
                Basically when you're implementing a design, you're catering to the user's attitudes and behaviors. 
                With the appropriate design, familiarity will be better presented within the medium that's being presented. 
                By following this process, you'll likely witness positive growths in customer satisfaction and sales.
